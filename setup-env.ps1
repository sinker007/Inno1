# =================================================================
# Environment Setup Script for Third-Party Risk Radar
#
# This script prepares your local environment to run the application
# without Docker. It performs the following actions:
# 1. Checks for essential prerequisites (Python, Node.js, ODBC Driver).
# 2. Creates a Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
# 3. Installs backend dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.
# 4. Installs frontend dependencies from `frontend/package.json`.
