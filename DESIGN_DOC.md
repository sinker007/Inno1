# Third‑Party Risk Radar Strategy Document

## 1. Design Overview
**Objective**: Provide continuous, business‑contextual monitoring of third-party/vendor risk for SMBs, with a roadmap to scale into enterprise/finance.

**Core Components**:
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects vendor signals (SSL/TLS, DNS, leaked creds, breach intel, compliance docs).
- **Risk Scoring Engine**: Multi‑factor scoring (technical posture, compliance, financial stability, breach history).
- **Business Mapping Module**: Links vendors to business processes and criticality.
- **Alerting & Dashboards**: Executive‑friendly visuals, heatmaps, and exportable reports.
- **Integration Hooks**: APIs for GRC, SIEM, and ticketing systems.

**Security Controls**:
- Role‑based access control (RBAC).
- Encryption in transit and at rest.
- Audit logging for compliance.
- Regular penetration testing (scaled with market tier).

## 2. Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1 – SMB SaaS Launch (0–12 months)
- Continuous monitoring of vendor digital footprint.
- Basic risk scoring + simple dashboards.
- Automated questionnaires (lightweight).
- Mid‑tier pentest (~$20k) for credibility.
- **Target**: SMBs needing affordable vendor risk visibility.

### Phase 2 – Mid‑Market Expansion (12–24 months)
- Advanced risk scoring with business impact overlays.
- Evidence collection (SOC 2, ISO certs).
- Integrations with GRC/SIEM tools.
- Compliance‑friendly reporting (GDPR, HIPAA).
- Larger pentest scope (~$40k–$60k).

### Phase 3 – Enterprise/Finance Readiness (24–36 months)
- Hybrid/private cloud deployment options.
- Executive simulation labs (tabletop exercises).
- Continuous pentesting + SOC 2 / ISO 27001 certification.
- Enterprise‑grade pentest ($75k–$100k+).
- **Target**: Banks, insurers, global enterprises.

## 3. Go‑to‑Market Roadmap

### Target Segments
- **Phase 1**: SMBs in professional services, SaaS, healthcare startups.
- **Phase 2**: Mid‑market firms with compliance mandates (regional banks, fintechs, healthcare providers).
- **Phase 3**: Large financial institutions, insurers, global supply chains.

### Positioning
- **SMB**: “Affordable vendor risk radar—compliance made simple.”
- **Mid‑Market**: “Automated vendor risk management that scales with your compliance needs.”
- **Enterprise/Finance**: “Regulator‑ready third‑party risk intelligence with business impact clarity.”

### Sales & Distribution
- **SMB**: Self‑serve SaaS sign‑ups, partner channels (MSPs, MSSPs).
- **Mid‑Market**: Direct sales + compliance consultants.
- **Enterprise**: RFP‑driven sales, strategic partnerships, analyst coverage.

### Pricing Strategy
- **SMB**: Subscription tiers ($500–$2,000/month).
- **Mid‑Market**: $2,000–$10,000/month depending on vendor count.
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, six‑figure annual contracts.

## 4. Key Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of vendors monitored per customer.
- **Retention**: Renewal rates across SMB → enterprise tiers.
- **Trust**: Pentest/compliance certifications achieved.
- **Revenue Growth**: Expansion from SMB SaaS to enterprise contracts.

## Core Architecture Principles
- **Cloud‑native**: Elastic scaling, global reach, and integration with vendor APIs.
- **Modular/Microservices**: Easier to evolve features (risk scoring, dashboards, integrations).
- **Security‑first**: Encryption, IAM, audit logging baked in from day one.
- **Compliance‑ready**: SOC 2 / ISO 27001 alignment in design (logging, monitoring, data segregation).

## ⚙️ Suggested Tech Stack

### 1. Frontend (User Dashboards & Reports)
- **Framework**: React (mature ecosystem, great for dashboards) or Next.js (SEO + SSR).
- **UI Library**: Material UI or Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent design.
- **Charts/Visuals**: D3.js or Recharts for risk heatmaps and executive visuals.

### 2. Backend (APIs & Risk Engine)
- **Language/Framework**:
  - **Node.js (Express/Fastify)** → great for rapid API development.
  - **Python (FastAPI)** → strong for data processing, ML‑driven risk scoring.
- **Architecture**: Microservices with REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **Auth & Security**: OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect (Auth0, Azure AD).

### 3. Data Layer
- **Transactional DB**: PostgreSQL (structured vendor data, compliance evidence).
- **Analytics/Scoring**: ElasticSearch or OpenSearch (fast querying of vendor signals).
- **Data Lake**: AWS S3 / Azure Blob for raw intel feeds, logs, and historical data.

### 4. Risk Intelligence & Monitoring
- **Threat Intel Feeds**: Integrate APIs (HaveIBeenPwned, VirusTotal, Shodan, etc.).
- **Cloud Security Posture**: AWS Security Hub / Azure Security Center connectors.
- **Custom Scanners**: Python‑based modules for SSL/DNS hygiene checks.

### 5. Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS or Azure (finance clients often prefer Azure for compliance).
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes (EKS/AKS) for portability and scaling.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with security gates (SAST/DAST).
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

### 6. Security & Compliance
- **Logging/Monitoring**: ELK stack or Splunk.
- **SIEM Integration**: Optional hooks for enterprise buyers.
- **Compliance Automation**: Drata or Vanta (SOC 2 readiness).

### 7. Future‑Proofing (Enterprise Phase)
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Support for private cloud (Azure VNet, AWS VPC).
- **Zero Trust**: Fine‑grained IAM, service‑to‑service auth.
- **Data Residency Controls**: Region‑specific storage for EU/UK/US.
